# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 24, 2020

**Today's progress:** Today I start the challenge and I want to start it by improving my website.

**Thoughts:** I currently have my website in basic html code but I want to have it as a web application in reactJS, I am going to start with this challenge improving it and taking up my knowledge of code which I have a little abandoned.
